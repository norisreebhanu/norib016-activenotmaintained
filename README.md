# norib016-activenotmaintained
Active repository. Previous account(norib016) remains public but is no longer accessible due to lost 2FA.

## ⚠️ Repository Migration Notice

This repository is the **official and actively maintained version** of my future projects.

My previous GitHub repository is **still publicly available**, but I am permanently **locked out of that account due to loss of 2FA authenticator access after a phone reset**.

As a result, the older repository is **no longer maintained**.

✅ **All updates, fixes, and new development will happen here going forward.**
